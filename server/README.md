# Text Alchemy Backend API (Spring Boot)

This repository contains the backend API for the Text Completion Deep Learning Model. The backend is built using **Spring Boot** and integrates with a pre-trained deep learning model for generating text completions. The API allows users to submit incomplete text and receive the predicted continuation.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot 3.0+**
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Data JPA** for database access
- **Spring Web** for building RESTful APIs
- **Spring Boot Starter Security** for basic authentication (optional)
- **TensorFlow Java** for loading the deep learning model
- **H2 Database** (for local development) or **PostgreSQL** (for production)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
